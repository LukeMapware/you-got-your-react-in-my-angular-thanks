- [x] get React portion working
- [x] create anchor for React in Angular
- [x] js/ts config for path alias
- [ ] create Angular "hooks"
- [ ] create router+MutationObserver example
- [ ] create shared state example

## The First Adventure

- [x] create PostList component in angular
- [x] replicate HTML & CSS
- [x] fill with mock data
- [x] adapt query to get data
- [x] get data in
- [x] wire in post selection
	- [x] access navigation/routing
	- [x] have NG & React change when route changes

### Mixing Components

- [ ] move PostDetail to angular

### Sharing State

- [ ] create state slice
- [ ] connect slice to angular component
- [ ] update store
- [ ] reflect store change in React

## Connect

- [x] can i get an `onChange` hook for ng components just for debugging?
- [ ] Can I make a shortcut for `mapStateToProps` so I don't need to explicitly have functions that
  call `(state) => state`?
- [ ] I should do something so that I don't have to call `store.dispatch(api.endpoints.getPosts.initiate())`
